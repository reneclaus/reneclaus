Rene leverages a diverse background working with math and optimization heavy
systems to explore the inner workings of large language models (LLMs).

His current research delves into the emergent structures within LLMs, aiming to
bridge the gap between complex model behavior and the underlying mechanisms that
drive it.

This website serves as a platform for his ongoing exploration of LLMs, offering
insights into these powerful AI systems.
